            The Vickers was the British Army’s standard machine gun from 1912. Female tanks were armed with 4.  Chambered in .303 caliber, it had a water filled jacket to cool the barrel, increasing the weight but allowing it to be fired for very long periods.  Indeed the Vickers’ reliability soon became legendary. Female tanks carried 24,320 rounds in 76 boxes, each containing 320 rounds in canvas belts.   The gunners sat on a small saddle fixed to the rotating gun mount. Because of the rapid fire and dispersion of their machine guns, Female tanks generally stood a better chance of hitting their targets than Males, especially if they fired at an area target such as a body of troops.

        The lighter Hotchkiss machine gun was the secondary armament of both Male and Female tanks.  Males carried 3, one in each sponson behind the 6 pounder and one at the front. Females had just the front weapon.  It fired the same .303 ammunition as the Vickers, but from 30 round metal strips, meaning it had to be reloaded more often. It was also air cooled, making it lighter but lowering its rate of fire. The first versions were fitted with a bulky wooden stock, awkward inside a tank.  Male tanks carried 6272 rounds.

            The 8 man crew also carried personal weapons. These were .455 caliber Webley Mark VI revolvers, far smaller and lighter than the infantry’s rifles. There were a number of loopholes around the vehicle that the crews could open and fire through at enemy soldiers who couldn’t be reached by any other weapon. Revolvers were useful, but limited.  They held 6 shots, and even the 50 yard range quoted in the training manual was optimistic in combat. The Mark I’s armament set the pattern for First World War heavy tanks.  The Mark IV introduced a shorter barrelled, but functionally identical 6 pounder. The Mark IV was also fitted with the Lewis gun in place of the Vickers and Hotchkiss, although the Hotchkiss would be reinstated on the Mark Vs and Whippets of 1918.
