            Immediately before and during the war, the British produced an enormous array of prototype tanks and modified tanks for a variety of specialist tasks (see Hobart's Funnies). For example, the Churchill AVRE mounted a 230 mm (11.4") direct-fire mortar which was used for destroying buildings and clearing obstacles. Responsibility for the buildup of vehicles and the training of crews to use them was given to armored warfare expert Percy Hobart after whom the collection was named.

        Many of the ideas had already been tried, tested or were in experimental development both by Britain and other nations. For example, the Scorpion flail tank (a modified Matilda tank) had already been used during the North African campaign to clear paths through German minefields. Soviet T-34 tanks had been modified with mine-rollers. Close-support tanks, bridgelayers, and fascine carriers had been developed elsewhere also. However, the Funnies were the largest and most elaborate collection of engineering vehicles available.
        By early 1944, Hobart could demonstrate to Eisenhower and Montgomery a brigade each of swimming DD tanks, Crab mine clearers, and AVRE (Engineer) tanks along with a regiment of Crocodile flamethrower tanks.

The first purpose-designed infantry tanks were the Matilda I model, armed with a machine gun and Matilda II, armed with a machine gun and QF 2-pounder anti-tank gun. Manufacturers built 2,987 Matilda IIs between 1940 and 1943.
The Matilda tanks were followed by the Valentine and Churchill tanks, designed using an interior and chassis layout of an experimental model called A10. The Valentine was developed in 1939 and by 1944, 8,275 had been built. Although it was stable and reliable, it was hampered by its small size.
