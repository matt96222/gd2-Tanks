            The real threat posed by postwar heavy soviet tanks like the IS-3 and others asked for an even better protected/better-armed tank than the Centurion and led to the design of the Conqueror. Indeed, while the Centurion was rearmed with the 20-pdr (83 mm), the 120 mm of the IS-3 was still superior, supposedly in range, and at least on impact. It was not known at that time the poor rate of fire and accuracy of the gun compared to Western standards. The master ace of the Conqueror was its massive 120 mm L1 rifled gun and a formidable frontal armor of 180 mm or 7 inches of solid RHA. But this was paid by pachydermic dimensions and 65 tons that took their toll on the Rolls-Royce Meteor M120 810 hp (604 kW), resulting in a speed of only 34 kph at best on flat, and serious reliability issues. The mobility however equalled the famous ww2 Churchill on all terrains. The range of fire or ammunition carried were not impressive either due to the use of separate charge and projectile, a common practice for those caliber rounds. A transitional serie armed with the 20-pdr was called FV 221 Caernarvon. In all, 165 were built. There was even a planned tank with an 183 mm gun.

        But the arrival of the 105 mm armed Centurion led to the rapid retirement of the Conquerors posted in Germany and the heavy tank concept was definitively buried. The Conqueror heavy tank was the last of its kind in British service. Built on purpose to defeat heavy soviet armor like the IS series, this model was only built to a few numbers. Because of its weight and being underpowered, mobility was poor and never compensated for its heavy armor and big rifled gun. Advanced ammunition of less calibers like on the Centurion armed with the 105 mm L7 rendered the concept obsolete over time.

            To replace the centurion with an even better tank was not an easy task, but it was accomplished with a great deal of success with the FV 2010 Chieftain. This second generation MBT received better armor than before, the hull itself had a subtle recess which allowed the frontal armor slope to be even flattened than before. The turret integrated for the first time better armor, dissipating energy through several layers of steel, and some add-ons with rubber and concrete embedded in plastic cells.

The Chieftain set a brand new standard in NATO for main battle tanks, introducing a sophisticated RHA armor (Stillbrew armor package) and a very efficient 120 mm rifled gun. The Chieftain’s early teething problems were solved when doubling the power of its main engine and general reliability of the multifuel system and transmission. A derivative of the Chieftain for export to Jordan (Shir II) was used as a basis for the Challenger.
The main gun was also a leap forward, with a 120 mm rifled gun that could fire bigger rounds, and improved optics systems. By the standards of the same year, both the French AMX-30, German Leopard-I, and M60 on NATO’s side were found inferior, while the T-62s and T-64s in the USSR were not as well protected and their main gun certainly not as accurate. The Achilles heel of this model was the mobility however, with teething problems at the beginning due to a massive weight, and underpowered, badly managed multi fuel power plant. These were solved with the Mark.III and especially the Mark.Vs in the early 1980s and the Chieftain remained in service well into the early 1990s. It was also exported to Iran, Jordan, Oman and Kuwait. The Jordanian version was refined to such a point that it became the basis for the next gen. MBT, the Challenger.
