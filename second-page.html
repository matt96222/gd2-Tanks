            The world’s first tank, as we know it, was invented in Britain and grew out of a prototype by Fosters of Lincoln. It was known as ‘Little Willie’ and was in production by the end of 1915.
            Little Willie was built from components designed by a number of industrialists, including imported American tracks and drawing on technologies developed on previous war projects. It was built on an unsuspended track frame and fitted with a non-rotatable dummy turret with a machine gun mount. It was 8m-long and needed two men to drive it; one for steering, clutch, gearbox and throttle operation, and another for brakes. Another four operated the weapons. It was protected with boiler-plate armor and could only travel at two miles per hour.

            But Little Willie never went into combat, even though it was developed during The Great War between 1914 and 1918. Instead, it led the way for another prototype, Big Willie and later Mother, which used a rhomboid track frame that let the tracks move right around the vehicle, and the turret was replaced with armament inside sponsons.
            The first tank to actually engage in battle within the British armed forces was known as Mark I. This tank had two variants a 28t male, armed with two six-pounder guns and three 8mm Hotchkiss machine guns and the 27t female variant had four 0.303 Vickers machine guns and a single Hotchkiss. Each tank carried eight soldiers.

        British heavy tanks were a series of related armored fighting vehicles developed by the United Kingdom during World War I. The Mark I was the world’s first tank, tracked and armed armored vehicle, to enter combat. The name “tank” was initially a code name to maintain secrecy and disguise its true purpose. This type of tank was developed to break the stalemate of trench warfare and could survive the machine gun and small-arms fire in “No Man’s Land,” travel over difficult terrain, crush barbed wire, and cross trenches to assault fortified enemy positions with powerful armament along with carrying supplies and troops.
        British heavy tanks are distinguished by their unusual rhomboidal shape with a high climbing face of the track, designed to allow the tank to cross the wide and deep trenches common on the Western Front. Due to the height necessary for this shape, an armed turret would have made the vehicle too tall and unstable. Instead, the main armament was arranged in sponsons at the side of the vehicle. The first prototype, called “Mother,” mounted a six-pounder (57 mm) cannon and a Hotchkiss machine gun at each side. Later, subtypes were produced with machine guns only, which were designated “Female,” while the original version with the protruding 6-pounder was called “Male.”
        The Mark I entered service in August 1916 and was first used in battle on the morning of September 15, 1916 during the battle of Flers-Courcelette, part of the Somme Offensive. With the exception of a few interim Mark II and III tanks, it was followed by the largely similar Mark IV, which first saw combat in June 1917. The Mark IV was then used en masse, with roughly 460 tanks, at the Battle of Cambrai that November. The Mark V, with a much-improved transmission, entered service in mid-1918. More than 2,000 British heavy tanks were produced until their manufacture was discontinued at the end of the war.

The first purpose-designed infantry tanks were the Matilda I model, armed with a machine gun and Matilda II, armed with a machine gun and QF 2-pounder anti-tank gun. Manufacturers built 2,987 Matilda IIs between 1940 and 1943.
The Matilda tanks were followed by the Valentine and Churchill tanks, designed using an interior and chassis layout of an experimental model called A10. The Valentine was developed in 1939 and by 1944, 8,275 had been built. Although it was stable and reliable, it was hampered by its small size.
