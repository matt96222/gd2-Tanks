            The first British tanks carried a formidable array of weaponry into battle. The original production order was for 100 tanks.  Their main armament would be two Ordnance Quick Firing 6 pounder Hotchkiss 8cwt guns. This was a Royal Navy weapon adopted as much because it was available as because it was best suited for the role.  Secondary armament was to be the Hotchkiss light machine gun.
            When the Army increased the order to 150 tanks a problem arose. There weren't enough 6 pounders. There wasn’t time to wait for more to be built, so it was decided to fit half the tanks with Vickers heavy machine guns instead, resulting in Male and Female tanks. Another reason for building Females was the fear that gun armed tanks might be overwhelmed by massed infantry attack. Mark Is used on the Somme in 1916 and at Arras in 1917 were armed with these weapons.

        The 120×570mm are one-piece ammunition with semi-combustible cartridge cases. These incorporate a short, metallic stub case with an elastomeric sealing ring which allows the use of a normal sliding wedge type of breech and at the same time significantly reduces the weight of the rounds. Thus, a round of 120 mm Rheinmetall APFSDS ammunition has a mass of 19.8 kg, which is little more than the 18 kg mass of a typical 105 mm APFSDS round with the traditional metallic cartridge case.

            The 6 pounder had been in use with the Navy since the 1880s and the tank’s designers adopted it because it was small enough to fit in the vehicle, but still offered a good level of firepower. The gun was of 57mm caliber and fired a shell weighing 6 pounds (2.72kg).  It could be aimed using a x2 telescope or simple open sights.
The first gunners were trained by the Navy, partly because they had existing knowledge of the weapon, but also because it was believed that the motion of a ship would be similar to that of a tank. In the end firing it accurately on the move proved essentially impossible.  The vibration of the tank meant the gunner couldn’t see anything through the telescope, and even if he could, he’d struggle to keep the gun on target.
Mark Is carried 334 rounds, made up of High Explosive and solid shot.  Perhaps reflecting lessons learned about its usefulness on the move, the later Mark V reduced this considerably to 207, of which 24 were the new canister shot, intended for use against infantry. The gunner had to squat to the left of the gun and the loader to the right, meaning the two guns had slightly different firing arcs.  Their trajectories converged at a point 60 yards in front of the tank.
