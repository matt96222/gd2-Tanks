            The fall of the Soviet Union was of some consequence to British Forces. Noteworthy, the British Armored Division deployed in Germany was repatriated to the UK. However, if military spending were reduced, there would be no spectacular cuts in programs. In 1988, the IFV Warrior was launched by Alvis (now BAE systems) and declined into six variants. The BAE Stormer family of vehicles was introduced, as well as the new British self-propelled howitzer, the AS.90. More importantly the new Challenger II main battle tank was also introduced in service and replaced the Challenger 1.

            Challenger MBT: The last Cold War British MBT was based on the latest evolution of the Chieftain originally intended for Iran, which entered service in 1982. It was lighter and much faster than the former, and better protected with a new generation of composite armor, the famous “Chobham '' armor also used by the M1 Abrams. The first Challenger was produced to 480 vehicles until 1990 before being replaced by the even faster Challenger II. The latter introduced a whole range of improvements in several directions, starting with a new FCS, digitized central battle management system among others, and of course a new gun, the 120-millimeter (4.7 in) 55-caliber rifled L30A1.
